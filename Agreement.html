<br> 1.	Services. Vendor shall provide Company with access to its private restrooms located at [Vendor Restroom Address] (the “Restrooms”),<br> which are available

<br>clean and sanitary condition, and shall make them available to Company’s customers at all times during the hours of operation of Vendor’s business. Vendor shall also
<br>provide a point of contact for any issues related to the Restrooms.
<br>
<br>2.	Compensation. Company shall pay Vendor $1 for each use of the Restrooms by a customer who has purchased access through the App.
<br> Payments shall be made on a weekly basis, and shall be calculated based on the number of Restroom uses recorded by the App 
<br>during the previous week. Vendor shall be solely responsible for any taxes or other fees associated with the compensation received under this Agreement.
<br>3.	Liability. Vendor shall be solely responsible for any liability arising out of or in connection with the use of the Restrooms 
<br>by Company’s customers, including any accidents or injuries that may occur on the premises. Company shall not be responsible or liable for any such claims, 
<br>and Vendor shall indemnify and hold Company harmless from any and all claims arising out of or in connection with the use of the Restrooms by Company’s customers.
<br>4.	Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days’ written notice. <br>Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately,
<br>and without notice if Vendor fails to maintain the Restrooms in a clean and sanitary condition, or if Vendor breaches any other material term of this Agreement. 
<br>In the event of termination, Vendor shall immediately cease providing access to the Restrooms through the App, and any compensation owed to Vendor shall be prorated based
<br>on the number of Restroom uses recorded by the App up to the date of termination.
<br>5.	Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State], without <br>giving effect to its conflicts of 
<br>law principles. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of

<br>whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No modification or waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties.
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.<br>
